    "It somehow worked to parse the PDFs, although it was quite a pain. Some very basic insights can probably already be generated across PDF files, although the stability of the parsing was only tested for two PDFs before boredom won out. The parsing with PyPDF2 while convenient seems to have issues with special characters, dropping entire words (like names of MEPs). So some investigation of better practises would be next."
